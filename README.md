# Document-the-QA-flow
A flowchart diagram representing the QA process for testing, defect tracking, and release validation. This visual helps map the decision-making flow and ensures consistent QA execution across different phases of the developmentÂ lifecycle.
Created as part of my QA training to demonstrate understanding of test lifecycle and defect management  process.
QA Process Flowchart

This project contains a visual flowchart representing the QA process lifecycle. The flow was designed to illustrate a typical QA workflow, including:

- Test planning and design
- Functional and regression test execution
- Defect reporting and retesting
- Release decision-making

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Draw.io (for flowchart creation)
- PDF export
- Visual QA board (manual design)

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project was created as part of my QA training to help visualize the structure of software testing stages and better understand the logic behind QA decision trees.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Mapping QA processes visually
- Working with conditional decision points
- Understanding the sequence of actions from test planning to release

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- QA-Flowchart.pdf: The final flowchart of the QA process
